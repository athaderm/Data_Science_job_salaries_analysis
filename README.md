### Objectives

The primary goal is to provide an overview/analysis on what is being paid in Data Science jobs.

Some questions that was asked:
- What is the distribution of salaries?
- Is there an association between salary and experience?
- What is the distribution of remote ratio?
- Does on site work pays better than remote work?
- Is it better to work as a Data analyst or as a Data Engineer?
